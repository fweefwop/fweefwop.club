If you’ve ever wanted to know if hacking in real life is really like how it is in the movies, this is the course for you. From hooded vigilantes to white-collar officials, the world of hacking is wide and diverse in fiction, but just how much of that can be applied to real life? 
                
This set of ***6 mini workshop sessions*** is intended to give students an introduction to the world of cybersecurity. ***These classes are aimed towards students with no prior experience***, and will provide them a foundation in operating Linux, exploiting websites, cryptography, steganography, and OSINT(Open Source Intelligence). ***The courses will also feature a hand-on lab for each topic***, which the students may continue to work on outside of the lecture.
