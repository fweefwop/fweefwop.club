title = "STEMBoost Summer Workshops"
+++

Over the years our club has hosted several summer cyber workshops. These workshops are designed for students from grade 5 to 9. They introduce students to computing safety, the basics of Linux and other fundamentals of cybersecurity. The workshops use a combination of CTF and other interactive activities to engage students.

### What is a CTF?
A CTF (“capture-the-flag”) competition is a type of cybersecurity competition where contenders can solve problems and answer questions in exchange for “flags.” Flags are pieces of text that can be submitted for points, and may look something like “flag{this_is_a_flag}.”
### When is it?
